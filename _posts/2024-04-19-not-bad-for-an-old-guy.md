# Getting 'er done

Just a little post on my newest blog out of ... (how many?) over the years.

Someday, perhaps I'll conslidate all the posts I've made since 2007 or so into one blog. At least, the ones I can find. So much lost to time, and broken hard discs, and stolen laptops, and shattered dreams... but I digress.

I've got the most important thing: my daughter, and the opportunity and duty I bear with pride to raise her the best I can. 
And man, she is *amazing*. She's growing into such a strong young woman.
She did ice dips with me every day (_almost_) for six months this winter!!! Seriously! No, _*srsly*_ she did. Isn't that awesome?

Anyways. Here I am, again. Still. Alive. Thank God. It hasn't been easy. But I keep on truckin', grinding, shredding... onwards and upwards!

Let's do this.

Check out my [LinkedIn Profile][linkedin-profile] for more info about me, or my [developer website][devsite] to learn more about me. It's got a [one-pager resume][resume] also, though I think my new LI profile is more meaningful by far. 
Who am I kidding? I built this to impress (or at least, hopefully, satisfy?) the weirdly awesome hiring peeps at Galactic Dev anyways. 

You're gonna hire me, right?
I'd like that.
I think we can do great things together.
Plus, you got anyone else on the team that can show you the goods at Whistler-Blackcomb?
Nah. Didn't think so.

So, let's shred together.
