Hey, I'm a single dad and I'm tired, give me a break. I'm working on it!

Here's a picture of some of our kittens to placate you.

But, no. No kittens for you. Jekyll keeps eating my kittens (photos).
It's a problem for another day.
I've got a bedtime, you know.
Good night.

Ok great. Fixed that. I needed to create the folders/resources _outside_ of the _site folder, which Jekyll regenerates while serving/building.
